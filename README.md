#### I am Wulan.
Sounds familiar? yeah, I am kinda proud that my name sounds similar to Mulan. At least it helps in teaching people how to pronounce it easier.

I am an Environmental Engineer, currently doing my PhD program at the University of Rhode Island. I am interested in global hydrologycal modeling, remote sensing, GIS, global carbon cycle and inland water quality.
I have always been interested in coding, but I guess I wasn't taking it serious enough and didn't make time for it. Well, now I am learning it in NRS-528. It gets me so excited.
